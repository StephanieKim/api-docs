# Need Help?

We're here to help you! If you are just getting started with Algorithmia, be sure to check out the getting started guides and tutorials.

This documentation is intended to help you integrate Algorithmia into your project or app, so if you haven't found the answer to your question please reach out. We'd love to help you get up and running as soon as possible! We're here to answer any question you might have, from pricing to troubleshooting to helping you publish an algorithm.

For any wrapper or library related issue, please open an issue on the dedicated GitHub repository.

## FAQ

Algorithmia is a platform for sharing the world's algorithmic knowledge in a way that is scalable, composable, easy-to-integrate, and always live. We want to place the cutting edge of algorithms technology in the hands of every developer, researcher, and business. In this FAQ, you can find quick answers to common questions.

### What languages do you support?

The Algorithmia REST API can be accessed in any language. To learn about the REST API, more information can be found in our getting started guide or you can find documentation for a specific client under the [Clients](#clients) section.

### How much does using Algorithmia cost?

Every account comes with 10,000 free credits and more credits can be earned by contributing algorithms to the platform. Beyond the free tier, Algorithmia credits must be purchased. Find more information in the [pricing](#pricing) section.

The cost of running an algorithm has two components: the algorithm price set by the developer or developers of the algorithm(s) used as well as the time it takes to run the job.

### I would like to take an algorithm from Algorithmia offline for my application, what can I do?

Contact us and we will put you in contact with the original algorithm developer.

### How do I get my data into Algorithmia? Can I upload data for processing?

For simple cases, you can feed the data into an algorithm at request time.

To upload data, you can use our Data API. The Data API is great for applications with larger data requirements or to batch process raw datasets.

We also offer algorithms to transfer data from Amazon S3, SQL databases, and other data sources. More data sources are being added regularly but if there is a specific data source you need, we'd love to hear from you!

### I want to offer a reward for the bounty I posted, how do I pledge it?

To create a bounty for an algorithm, simply click the 'Pledge' button to fund it. See Pledging a Bounty for more information on the pledge. Be sure to check out Bounties page for tips on how to write an effective bounty.

### I found a bug in an algorithm or it's not producing the expected results, what can I do?

The quickest way to give feedback on a particular algorithm is by leaving a comment on the algorithm's page so that the author will be immediately notified. You can also contact us.

### Algorithmia is misbehaving or I know a way it could be better.

You can log any bugs or propose a new features at the [Algorithmia support repo](https://github.com/algorithmiaio/support) on GitHub or email us directly.

### I am part of an educational institution or doing research. Is there a special program for me?

Yes! Please contact us. We would love to learn about your project and see if we can donate free credits.
