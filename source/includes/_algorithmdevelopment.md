# Algorithm Development

As an Algorithmia user, in addition to having access to hundreds of algorithms, you also have the ability to add your own algorithms. You can write a private algorithm for your own use, contribute an open source algorithm, or monetize an algorithm you authored. Our algorithms and platform are designed with composability in mind, so think of algorithms in the marketplace as building blocks.


We currently support algorithm development in Java, Scala, and Python, but we are working on expanding this list. If you have algorithma code you'd like to host on the Algorithmia platform in a different language, please get in touch! We are able to host executables in some special cases.
