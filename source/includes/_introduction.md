# Introduction

Welcome to the Algorithmia API documentation! You can use the API to access any algorithm in the marketplace.

We have clients & libraries in multiple languages. We encourage you to click on the different language tabs at the top of the right-side pane to see code samples in your language of choice. 

This documentation will serve as a reference as you start to integrate Algorithmia into your code.
